Abstract: Steady-state evoked potential (SSVEP) responses at the update rate of dot motion displays have been interpreted to reflect local motion processing (Gilmore et al., 2007; Hou et al., 2009). An alternative account posits that these responses index luminance modulation, not motion. We varied dot/background luminance contrast and dot lifetime to address the discrepancy between these accounts. We measured SSVEP responses of n=20 adult subjects (mean age: 20.35 years; 13 female) to random dot kinematogram displays that modulated in time from rotational motion of 100% coherence to 0% coherence at a rate of 1.2 Hz (F1). Dots were displaced 10 amin in all conditions at an update rate of 24 Hz (F2). Conditions varied in percentage of luminance contrast between dots and background (5%, 10%, 20%, 40%, or 80%). A second set of conditions featured identical luminance contrast (80%), but varied in dot lifetime setting (1, 2, or 100 updates). Dot update response (1F2) amplitudes varied as a function of luminance contrast, but were above noise levels for luminance contrasts greater than 20%. Dot update response amplitudes were similar in the motion (2 and 100 update) conditions relative to the non-motion (1 update) condition. Thus, responses at the dot update rate consist of a mixture of both local luminance modulation and spatial displacement. The dot update response exhibits properties characteristic of local motion processing observed in V1 cells, and so the analysis of SSVEP responses at the dot update rate provides a convenient, noninvasive way to measure local motion processing.
