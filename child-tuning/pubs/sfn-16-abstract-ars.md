Abstract: 

Motion information is critical to the visual perception of objects.

We measured SSVEP responses of n=37 child subjects (mean age: 6.4 years; 16 female) to random 
dot kinematogram displays that differed between the figure and background in direction (delta 5 deg, delta 45 deg, delta 180 deg), coherence (delta 100%) and density (delta 10%). The displays were comprised of white dots on a black background of .7cd/m^2. The figure regions (4 - 9deg x 9deg squares) emerged and disappeared from the background at a rate of 1.2 Hz (F1) and the dot update rate was 36 Hz (F2). Each of the 5 conditions above was presented at two speeds (1.2 and 6.0 deg/s).

Explain Results for direction, speed and direction*speed interactions. Look at this for 1F1 and other multiples.

Analysis of SSVEP responses at varying direction, coherence and dot density provides a convenient, noninvasive way to measure local motion processing.







Old Abstract Example

Steady-state evoked potential (SSVEP) responses at the update rate of dot motion displays have 
been interpreted to reflect local motion processing (Gilmore et al., 2007; Hou et al., 2009). An 
alternative account posits that these responses index direction and speed modulation, not motion. We 
varied dot/background luminance contrast and dot lifetime to address the discrepancy between these 
accounts.  We measured SSVEP responses of n=20 adult subjects (mean age: 20.35 years; 13 female)  to random dot kinematogram displays that modulated in time from rotational motion of 100% coherence to 0% 
coherence at a rate of 1.2 Hz (F1). Dots were displaced 10 amin in all conditions at an update rate of 
24 Hz (F2). Conditions varied in percentage of luminance contrast between dots and background (5%, 10%, 
20%, 40%, or 80%). A second set of conditions featured identical luminance contrast (80%), but varied in
dot lifetime setting (1, 2, or 100 updates). Dot update response (1F2) amplitudes varied as a function 
of luminance contrast, but were above noise levels for luminance contrasts greater than 20%. Dot update 
response amplitudes were similar in the motion (2 and 100 update) conditions relative to the non-motion 
(1 update) condition. Thus, responses at the dot update rate consist of a mixture of both local 
luminance modulation and spatial displacement. The dot update response exhibits properties 
characteristic of local motion processing observed in V1 cells, and so the analysis of SSVEP responses 
at the dot update rate provides a convenient, noninvasive way to measure local motion processing.
