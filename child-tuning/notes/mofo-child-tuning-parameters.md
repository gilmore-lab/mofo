F1 = Fundamental Frequency
F2 = Dot Update Rate
Screen Refresh Rate = 72Hz
View Distance: 60.31  
Mean Lum: 40.73  
Contrast %: 90.00  
Pix size (Amin): 7.00  

### Calculate deg/s from amin

dx = 2 amin or 10 amin  
dt = 1/36

(amin / update) x (1 deg/60 amin) x (36 updates/sec) = deg/sec     


## Written Condition Description


####From Fesi et al. 2011

Participants viewed random dot kinematogram displays on a Mitsubishi Std Diamondtron 2060u monitor with an 800 x 600 pixel resolution and a refresh rate of 72 Hz at a viewing distance of 60 cm, and a 28deg x 28deg visual angle. The displays consisted of white dots (85 cd/m2 ) moving against a black screen of 0.7 cd/m2 (mean luminance = 43 cd/m2; luminance contrast = 90%) at a dot update rate of 36 Hz, and a screen refresh rate of 72 Hz. Dot displacement was 2 amin for conditions 1-5 having a speed of 2 amin and 10 amin for conditions 6-10, for a speed of 6/s. For the sake of compatibility with previous studies (Gilmore et al., 2007; Hou et al., 2009), we used unlimited dot lifetimes.

The displays contained four 9 deg x 9 deg square shaped ‘‘figure’’ regions that emerged from and disappeared into the background at a fixed frequency of 1.2 Hz (referred to as the fundamental frequency, or F1). Each display modulated between a Figure Off phase, during which all dot motion settings were identical, and a Figure On phase, during which regional motion contrast defined the figure regions (see Fig. 1). A full display cycle consisted of 833 ms of on/off modulation, with 417 ms of Figure On and 417 ms of Figure Off. The motion contrast types chosen were differences of uniform direction or global direction coherence.

#### More description

All patterns were displayed in an annular region 24° in outer and 4.8° inner diameter at the 60 cm viewing distance.

Amplitude modulations that exceeded 100 microVolts were rejected as artifact.
X children were excluded because they completed fewer than 3 trials per condition
X children were excluded due to experimenter error
