- rog refactored the repository to reflect the organization recommended in "Reproducible Research with R and RStudio" by Gandrud.
- exported all session files with 100 uV artifact threshold (Thresh100) to session-level CSV files. Session-level CSV files were renamed based on iSess (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS.csv) value.

- Started to review the mofo-RLS-file-convert.R function and how it works  

- To do
